## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Testing GitHub and RProjects

I should now be able to save this file to the default R project (which is set as the default get wd). Changes can be saved on the file and then committed t Github to act as a repository. 

Generally we want to...

tweak the file as needed
save changes locally
commit changes with a suitable comment
pull the github files down
push all files back to github

That way we have version control from Github and everyting local will match everything on Github
